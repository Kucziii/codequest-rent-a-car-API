This is a very simple car rental JSON API app.
It features 3 models: User, Office and Car (w. corresponding migrations).

Here are the user stories I want you to implement:

As an Office Owner I want to be able to:
- list all my cars
- see details of a selected car
- list all my present customers
- list all my past customers
- rent a car to a Customer
- collect a car from a Customer

As a Customer I want to be able to:
- list all available cars
- rent an available car
- return a car

An API app of course needs a front-end input. Feel free to come up with one :)
